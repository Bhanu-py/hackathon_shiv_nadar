# Penalised Regression Techniques
Hackathon conducted by machinehack.com on the prediction of sales of a commodity by Multivariate regression methods



The sales in the mega marts are critical to make them sustainable. As a matter of fact, the rise of several marts have created buyers of different categories which are critical about quality of product at the right price. 

In the Analytics Olympiad 2021, the data science & machine learning community has been challenged to build an ML model and predict the sales of each product from each outlet. The participants also need to use the model to analyse the properties of the product in the stores and find ways to increase sales.

                                      Data attributes: 
                                      Item_ID: Item Identification Number
                                      Item_W: Item Weight
                                      Item_Type: Item
                                      Item_MRP: MRP of the Product
                                      Outlet_ID: Outlet ID
                                      Outlet_Year: Outlet Establishment year
                                      Outlet_Size: Size of the outlet
                                      Outlet_Type: Type of the outlet
                                      Sales: Total sales from the outlet
                                      Train: 87864 rows x 09 columns
                                      Test: 37656 rows x 09 columns
                                                            
                                                            
The submission will be evaluated using the RMSE metric. One can use np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(actual, predicted)) to calculate the same
This hackathon supports private and public leaderboards
The public leaderboard is evaluated on 30% of Test data
The private leaderboard will be made available at the end of the hackathon which will be evaluated on 100% of Test data
The Final Score represents the score achieved based on the last submission of the participant for the private leaderboard.
